1. ðŸŽ– Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. With these conditions
 * [ ] You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of bank balance.
 * [ ] You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your spending threshold.
 * [ ] After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.
 * [ ] Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.
 * [ ] Write a function called calculateTax which takes an argument 'amount' and calculates the tax you need to pay.
 * [ ] Write a function named formatAmount which returns you amount in this format '$ 132.45' make the decimal fixed to 2 places.
```js
const SPENDING_THRESHOLD = 200;
const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
const PHONE_PRICE = 99.99;
const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;

var bank_balance = 303.91;
var amount = 0;
// your code goes here
while(amount < bank_balance){
    amount = amount + PHONE_PRICE;
        if(amount < SPENDING_THRESHOLD){
            amount = amount + ACCESSORY_PRICE;
        }
    amount = amount + (amount * TAX_RATE);
    alert(`Calculated purchase amount is ${amount}`); 
}


```
 â›‘ Answer of the above will `$334.76`.

2. ðŸŽ– Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen using `alert` (e.g. "2 is even").
```js


for(var i=0;i<=20;i++){
    if(i%2==0){
        alert(i+ "is even");
    }
    else{
        alert(i+" is odd");
    }
}


```

3. ðŸŽ–Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result in console (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").

for(var i=0;i<=10;i++) {
    alert(i*9);
}

4. ðŸŽ–Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).
(e.g.
"1 * 1 = 1"
"1 * 2 = 2"
"1 * 3 = 3"
"1 * 4 = 4"
.... for all 100 results)

    for(var i=0 ; i<=10 ; i++){
        for(var j=0 ; j<=10 ; j++){
            var product = i*j;
            
            console.log(`${i} * ${j} = ${product}`);
        }
    }


5. ðŸŽ–Show the following output using one loop.
```js
// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
// 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

for(var i=1 ; i<=2 ; i++){
    
    if( i ==2){
        console.log(` ${i+4}, ${i+5}, ${i+6}, ${i+7}, ${i+8} `);
    }
    else{
        console.log(` ${i}, ${i+1}, ${i+2}, ${i+3}, ${i+4}`);
    }
    
    }

```

6. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to add up the numbers 1 to 20.
```js
// Your code goes here
var i=0;
var add=0;
while(i <= 20){
    add += i;
    
    i++; 
} 
console.log(`Addition is ${add}`);



```

7. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to print out the even number from 1 to 20. (You'll need Modulus for this. And an IF Statement.)
```js
// Your code goes here
```
var i = 1 ;
while(i<=20) {
    if( i % 2 == 0){
        console.log(`${i} is even`);
    }
    else{
        console.log(`${i} is odd`);
    }
    i++;
}
